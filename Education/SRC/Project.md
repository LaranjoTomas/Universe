# To-do

Firewall between layer 3 connects
No loadballencers needed
#### Policy
Traffic incoming to building A need tunnels since only a firewall between those 2 right most layer 3s arent enough. The tunnel must force traffic to redirect packets from vlan 10 and vlan20 to go to throught the firewalls. place firewall between router processers.
